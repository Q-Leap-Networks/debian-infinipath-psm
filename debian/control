Description: PSM Messaging library for Intel Truescale adapters
 The PSM Messaging API, or PSM API, is Intel's (formerly QLogic's) low-level,
 user-level communication interface for the Truescale family of products. PSM
 users can use mechanisms necessary to implement higher-level communication
 interfaces in parallel environments.
